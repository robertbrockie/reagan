Paywalls are gross, let REAGAN tear them down.
This *very* simple Chrome extension will only work with the following sites:

* Slate
* *more coming soon*

# Installing

* Checkout the code somewhere
* Fire up Chrome
* Click *The Hamburger* (the 3 lines stacked on top of each other to the right of the url bar) -> *Settings*
* Click *Extensions*
* Click *Developer Mode* checkbox
* Click *Load unpacked extension...*
* Locate the code you just checked out
* Fire up Slate for some liberal reading, if you get a paywall click the friendly Reagan and icon, he'll tear down that paywall

Hope you enjoy it.
